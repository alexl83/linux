Subject: unix: Fix ABI change for CVE-2013-4312
Forwarded: not-needed

The fix for CVE-2013-4312 added a new structure member,
user_struct::unix_inflight.  As this is always allocated in
kernel/user.c and the new member is only used by af_unix which is also
built-in, we can safely add new members at the end.  So move it to the
end and hide it from genksyms.
