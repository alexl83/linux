Subject: tools/perf: pmu-events: Fix reproducibility
Forwarded: no

jevents.py enumerates files and outputs the corresponding C structs in
the order they are found.  This makes it sensitive to directory
ordering, so that the perf executable is not reproducible.

To avoid this, sort the entries returned by os.scandir() before
processing them.
