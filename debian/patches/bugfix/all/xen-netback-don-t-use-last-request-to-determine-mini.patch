Subject: [2/7] xen-netback: don't use last request to determine minimum Tx
 credit
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/0f589967a73f1f30ab4ac4dd9ce0bb399b4d6357

The last from guest transmitted request gives no indication about the
minimum amount of credit that the guest might need to send a packet
since the last packet might have been a small one.

Instead allow for the worst case 128 KiB packet.

This is part of XSA155.
